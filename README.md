<h1>The Unified and Recursive Maxwell-Boltzmann Framework</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

This project reinterprets the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution under the framework of the Unified Theory of Energy (UTE), replacing its classical Cartesian assumptions with a recursive dimensional energy model. Traditionally, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the statistical distribution of particle velocities in an idealized gas. However, this model relies on outdated assumptions about energy motion, failing to account for recursive energy storage, exchange, and transformation across degrees of surface interaction.

This work proposes an alternative statistical formulation that aligns with the recursive nature of energy, replacing conventional velocity components with Degrees of Surface Interaction (D=1,2,3...) and Extended Radiation (R) as the fundamental measures of energy distribution. This approach redefines the classical concepts of temperature, entropy, and kinetic motion while preserving energy conservation across recursive dimensions.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

The classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is an incomplete statistical model that restricts energy motion to artificial Cartesian velocity components. By incorporating Degrees of Surface Interaction and Recursive Energy Storage, we develop a more robust energy distribution function that conserves energy across dimensions without arbitrary constraints. This project aims to formalize a unified recursive framework that aligns statistical mechanics with a deeper understanding of energy recursion and conservation.
